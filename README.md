# RDoc
A block comment specification and documentation generation program based on rtypes

Rtypes offer an expressive way of representing function signatures and defining types & interfaces in JavaScript code.

RDoc allows developers to make use of Rtypes in expressive block comments which can generate documentation and also open the potential for powerful browser/IDE tooling.


# Comparison with RFX
 RFX provides developers with the same benefits listed above with the added benefit that code written in RFX is effectively _self documenting_. There are also potential performance benefits driving the project.
 
 For existing code, or new projects which cannot employ RFX, RDoc will offer a familiar pattern of block comment documentation similar to JSDoc, but with enhanced readability & maintainability in code, richer generated docs & powerful tooling potential.
